# AI-Augmented Cybersecurity Workflows

The Department of Defense (DoD) cybersecurity workforce faces an ever-growing challenge in safeguarding national security infrastructure against increasingly sophisticated threats. In this dynamic landscape, artificial intelligence (AI) presents a powerful opportunity to enhance cybersecurity operations. However, for many professionals, the transition from completing an online course to effectively applying AI in real-world cybersecurity scenarios remains unclear.

To bridge this gap, AI Sensei was developed—an initiative designed to equip the DoD workforce with the skills and knowledge needed for AI integration. By facilitating AI readiness, AI Sensei empowers personnel to seamlessly incorporate AI into existing workflows and explore new applications. This project focuses on expanding and refining the AI Sensei website, enhancing its capabilities to better support the DoD cybersecurity community.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Week 1
• Met with the project sponsor to define the project scope and review the previous team's work.

• Identified key objectives, clarified team responsibilities, and established an initial roadmap for the project.

• Reviewed existing documentation and assessed the overall feasibility of the MVP.

### Week 2 
• Assigned team members to analyze previously implemented use cases.

• Each member documented potential issues, identified areas for improvement, and assessed how the current implementation 
 aligns with the project goals.

### Week 3
#### Started Development of the Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

Began refining the platform based on previous findings.
Identified key areas for improvement, including usability, documentation, and technical enhancements.

#### Collaborated with the Previous Team Lead

Reviewed past development challenges and technical roadblocks.
Gained insights on Local Packet Whisper and Packet Raptor implementation issues.
Discussed potential solutions and enhancements for deployment.
#### Completed Phase 1 Gantt Chart & Project Planning

Established a basic timeline for development, testing, and deployment.
Defined milestones for feature implementation and debugging.
Established team responsibilities and checkpoints for progress tracking through the Gant Chart.
Next Steps:

• Refine and Update Instructions for Local Packet Whisper and Packet Raptor to ensure seamless deployment.

• Implement Initial MVP Enhancements, including UI/UX refinements and backend improvements.

• Test and Validate existing features, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems.

• Continue Collaboration with the Previous Team Lead to address pending technical challenges.

### Week 4
#### Further Refinement of the Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

Coordinated with Sponsor to Refine the MVP.
Engaged in discussions with our sponsor to align the MVP with project goals and expectations.
Gathered feedback on initial implementations and identified key refinements to improve functionality.
Incorporated recommended use cases to enhance the platform's practical applications.

#### Prepared for Subject Matter Expert (SME) Consultation

• Developed a structured approach to validate proposed changes with SMEs.

• Outlined critical areas for expert review, including usability, technical feasibility, and deployment strategy.

• Compiled documentation and supporting materials to facilitate productive discussions.

#### Adjustments of Roadmap
Revised Gantt Chart to reflect new priorities based on sponsor input.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
